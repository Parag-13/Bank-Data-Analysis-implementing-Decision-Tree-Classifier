# Bank-Data-Analysis-implementing-Decision-Tree-Classifier
The project involves developing a sophisticated data analysis system to identify Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) using bank transaction data. This is achieved through the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier Machine Learning Model using Python language.

Data Collection:
The dataset comprises anonymized bank transaction records, including attributes such as transaction amounts, frequencies, counterparties, geographic locations, and timestamps. Additionally, customer demographic information, such as age, occupation, and known affiliations, is included to enhance the model's predictive power.

Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as transaction volume, average transaction size, frequency of transactions with high-risk countries, etc.

Normalization and Scaling: Normalize continuous variables to ensure uniformity and scale features to enhance model performance.

Label Encoding: Encode categorical variables for numerical processing.

Model Implementation:

Algorithm Selection: Decision Tree Classifier is chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in handling both numerical and categorical data.

Training and Testing Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, typically with a 70-30 split.

Model Training: Utilize the training dataset to train the Decision Tree Classifier, tuning hyperparameters such as tree depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy and precision on the testing dataset to ensure robust performance.

Implementation in Python:
The model is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for model building, and matplotlib for visualization.

Outcome:

The final model identifies PEPs with high accuracy, providing banks with a reliable tool for regulatory compliance and risk management. The Decision Tree's interpretability aids in understanding the decision-making process, offering insights into key factors influencing the classification.

This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques in the financial sector, emphasizing the integration of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to address real-world challenges.
